# vinext-starter

A clean full-stack starter running on [vinext](https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext), with optional Cloudflare D1 and Drizzle support.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.13.0`
- Portable: Windows, macOS, or Linux; no Bash required
- Managed Linux: managed Linux runtime with Bash, `flock`, `curl`, `sha256sum`, and GNU `timeout`
- Git is required only for publishing

## Formatting

Run `npm run format` to format project files with the pinned Oxfmt version, or
`npm run format:check` to check formatting without writing changes. GitHub Actions
runs the same check on pull requests and pushes to `develop` and `main`.

Formatting uses two spaces, a line width of 100, double quotes, and semicolons.
Import, Tailwind class, and package field sorting are disabled. Vendored source,
generated files, and audio source artifacts are excluded in `.oxfmtrc.json`.
ESLint continues to handle code quality checks with `npm run lint`.

Zed's project settings in `.zed/settings.json` run the locally installed Oxfmt
on save for JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX, CSS, JSON/JSONC, HTML, Markdown, and YAML.
Run the project dependency install first; no editor extension or global formatter
installation is required. Open this repository root as the Zed project.

## Sites Lifecycle

The Sites initializer copies the shared starter and selects managed-linux only when `SITES_MANAGED_LINUX_CONTAINER=1`; otherwise it selects portable. It saves the selection only in ignored `.sites-runtime/execution-profile.json`. Both profiles copy/configure first, then use the plugin's separate `install-dependencies.mjs` step to measure installation independently. Edit source under `app/` and follow the Sites skill for installation, preview, builds, and publishing.

Run `node <plugin-root>/scripts/configure-execution-profile.mjs` only when the profile is unknown for the current checkout and environment. Profile changes do not alter tracked source or require reinstalling otherwise-valid dependencies; restart an existing preview to use the new selection. Do not commit or upload `.sites-runtime/`.

This starter does not use `wrangler.jsonc`.

`install:ci` runs `npm ci` once against the shared lockfile, disables parent-workspace discovery, and includes required dev/optional dependencies despite production/omit settings. Sharp defaults to prebuilt binaries unless explicitly configured otherwise. Do not overlap installers.

- **Portable:** Preserve host HOME, npm cache, registry, proxy, temporary paths, retry/concurrency settings, and lifecycle-script policy. Use `--prefer-offline --no-audit --no-fund`.
- **Managed Linux:** Use the existing project-local HOME/cache/tmp setup and Linux install lock, tarball preflight, and timeout. Restore the image-seeded npm cache only when its lockfile hash matches; retain network fallback. Builds keep their existing timeout. These helpers are not invoked by the portable profile.

`scripts/sites-env.mjs` preserves the caller's HOME, npm cache, proxy, XDG, and temporary-directory configuration while defaulting Wrangler and Miniflare state to the checkout. If npm reports an unwritable cache, select a writable path with `npm_config_cache` for that install. The `dev` and `start` scripts also keep Wrangler logs inside the checkout. Generated `.sites-runtime/` and `.wrangler/` directories are disposable and ignored by Git.

On portable, `npm run dev` uses `vinext dev` with HMR, starting at port 5173. Vinext records the running server in ignored `.vinext/` state, rejects an ordinary duplicate launch, and recovers stale state after a stopped process; exactly simultaneous starts can race. Pass `--port <port>` or `--hostname <host>` after `npm run dev --` when needed; keep portable previews on loopback.

For browser QA on managed Linux, use `sites-preview start`. The project's dev script runs Vite and accepts the supervisor's `--host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173 --strictPort` arguments. The internal browser uses `http://terminal.local:4173/`; it is not a user-facing URL. The supervisor owns the preview lifecycle. The ignored local profile survives the supervisor's cleared process environment.

The portable profile simulates ChatGPT sign-in only for loopback development requests. Visit `/signin-with-chatgpt?return_to=/` to sign in as `local_seedy` (`seedy@sites.test`, display name `Seedy`) and `/signout-with-chatgpt?return_to=/` to sign out. The development cookie preserves that identity across server restarts. Mock auth is disabled in the managed-linux profile and is not included in production builds; hosted authentication remains dispatch-owned.

The Worker uses `vinext/server/fetch-handler`, including Vinext's config-aware image handling. After building, `npm start` runs that Worker locally through Wrangler on `127.0.0.1`, sharing `.wrangler/state` with dev preview and local D1 migrations; it does not deploy the site or simulate sign-in. Use the URL printed by the server. Pass `npm start -- --port <port>` to select a different built-preview port.

Local previews use Miniflare's placeholder `Request.cf` metadata without a network lookup. Set `CLOUDFLARE_CF_FETCH_ENABLED=true` to opt into fetching preview metadata; this setting does not change hosted request metadata.

Local tool usage metrics are disabled by default. Set `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=true` to opt in.

## Included Shape

- edit site code under `app/`
- `app/chatgpt-auth.ts` provides optional dispatch-owned ChatGPT sign-in helpers
- `.openai/hosting.json` declares optional Sites D1 and R2 bindings
- `vite.config.ts` simulates declared bindings for local development
- `db/index.ts` reads the D1 binding from the Cloudflare Worker environment
- `db/schema.ts` starts intentionally empty
- `@cloudflare/workers-types` provides Worker types; `cloudflare-env.d.ts` declares optional `DB`/`BUCKET` bindings—update these declarations if binding names change
- `examples/d1/` contains an optional D1 example surface
- `drizzle.config.ts` supports local migration generation when needed

## Workspace Auth Headers

Signed-in visitors receive both `oai-authenticated-user-id` and `oai-authenticated-user-email`. Private Sites require every visitor to sign in; public Sites may also have anonymous visitors, for whom neither header is present.

The user ID is stable for the same user on the same Site and different across Sites. Use it as the durable user key; use email and name for display or contact purposes.

SIWC-authenticated workspace sites may also receive `oai-authenticated-user-full-name` when the user's SIWC profile has a non-empty `name` claim. The full-name value is percent-encoded UTF-8 and is accompanied by `oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding: percent-encoded-utf-8`.

Treat the full name as optional and fall back to email when it is absent:

```tsx
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export default async function Home() {
  const requestHeaders = await headers();
  const userId = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-id");
  const email = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-email");
  const encodedFullName = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name");
  const fullName =
    encodedFullName &&
    requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding") === "percent-encoded-utf-8"
      ? decodeURIComponent(encodedFullName)
      : null;

  const displayName = fullName ?? email;
  // ...
}
```

## Optional Dispatch-Owned ChatGPT Sign-In

Import the ready-to-use helpers from `app/chatgpt-auth.ts` when the site needs optional or required ChatGPT sign-in:

- Use `getChatGPTUser()` for optional signed-in UI.
- Use the returned `userId` as the stable user key for user-owned records; do not use email as a durable identifier.
- Use `requireChatGPTUser(returnTo)` for server-rendered pages that should send anonymous visitors through Sign in with ChatGPT.
- In a Server Component, start sign-in with `<a href={chatGPTSignInPath(returnTo)} target="_top">`. The auth helper module is server-only; do not import it into a Client Component.
- Do not use `fetch`, XHR, a client-side router, or a framework link that can prefetch the sign-in route. SIWC must start as a top-level navigation.
- Never request the AuthAPI authorization endpoint directly. The dispatch-owned `/signin-with-chatgpt` route must start the SIWC flow.
- Use `chatGPTSignOutPath(returnTo)` for browser sign-out links or actions.
- Pass a same-origin relative `returnTo` path for the destination after sign-in or sign-out. The helper validates and safely encodes it.
- Mark protected pages with `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` because they depend on per-request identity headers.

Dispatch owns `/signin-with-chatgpt`, `/signout-with-chatgpt`, `/callback`, the OAuth cookies, and identity header injection. Do not implement app routes for those reserved paths. Routes that do not import and call the helper remain anonymous-compatible.

SIWC establishes identity only; it does not prove workspace membership. Use the Sites hosting platform's access policy controls for workspace-wide restrictions, or enforce explicit server-side membership or allowlist checks.

Use SIWC for account pages, user-specific dashboards, saved records, and write actions tied to the current ChatGPT user. Leave public content anonymous.

## Local D1 migrations

For a D1-backed local preview, generate SQL with `npm run db:generate`. Build once through the Sites skill's build entrypoint (or `npm run build` for standalone use) to generate `dist/server/wrangler.json`, rebuilding if bindings change. From the project root, apply each pending migration in order:

```sh
node --import ./scripts/sites-env.mjs ./node_modules/wrangler/bin/wrangler.js d1 execute DB --local --config dist/server/wrangler.json --persist-to .wrangler/state --file drizzle/0000_example.sql
```

Replace the filename with the pending migration and `DB` with your D1 binding name if different. Use `.wrangler/state`, not `.wrangler/state/v3`; Wrangler adds the versioned directories. Do not replay migrations already applied locally. This updates only the preview database; publishing applies production migrations separately.

## Halloween 2026 preview

The floor event runs from October 31, 2026 at 00:00 through November 1 at 05:00 JST
(end exclusive). It does not recur in later years.

With `npm run dev`, visit `/ja?halloween=on#dance-floor` for the event or
`/ja?halloween=off#dance-floor` for the ordinary floor. The same query works on
`/en`. Without the query, the actual event dates apply. Production ignores this
preview query and always uses the fixed dates. The label, lantern and lighting
share this switch; the existing motion control still governs the lighting.

### Expiry and rollback plan

All seasonal page colors, decorations, cat accessories and bats use the same
`useHalloweenFloor()` flag. At the fixed end time the flag becomes false, the
seasonal attributes and components are removed, and bat animations are cancelled
on unmount. Visible tabs recheck at the boundary; hidden/restored tabs recheck on
visibility, page restore and focus. Time comes from the device clock. No annual
recurrence, persisted event state, server setting or expiry deployment is needed.

Seasonal styles live in `app/halloween.css`, imported only by the page integration.
The cat stacking rule is limited to an active Halloween scene. Shared
`app/globals.css`, the original image assets and guest-cat implementation are
unchanged. Keep future event edits in the seasonal files and conditional page
integration so they can be removed together.

The changes are separated by intent:

| Commit                    | Responsibility                                                           | Removal order              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `c607678`                 | Fixed dates, client subscription, development preview and schedule tests | After presentation removal |
| `3eb2138`                 | Seasonal presentation, stylesheet, artwork and page integration          | First                      |
| This documentation change | Preview, rollback and verification notes                                 | Independently removable    |

For an early return to the ordinary page, revert `3eb2138`. This removes the page
integration and all seasonal presentation together, leaving the unused schedule
module inert. For full code removal, revert `c607678` afterwards and remove this
documentation when it is no longer needed. Revert preserves subsequent history;
if later edits conflict, resolve those edits rather than resetting the branch.
Rebuild and deploy the reverted version through the normal, separately authorized
workflow. These rollback actions have not been executed.

### Verification status

On local Node.js v22.16.0, all 106 Node tests, TypeScript checking, formatting and
the production build passed after stylesheet separation. ESLint reported zero
errors and the two acknowledged existing `no-img-element` warnings. PC checks
before stylesheet separation confirmed cat-detail open/close, discovery-count
updates and the motion button's state change. The earlier production bundle was
also checked for fixed dates and removal of development-query reads.

SP screenshot comparison, actual animation stop/resume, guest-cat browser behavior
and visual rechecking after stylesheet separation remain incomplete. Browser
investigation stopped at the approved stopping condition; these are outstanding
acceptance checks, not successful checks or an approved deferral. Reconsider them
before accepting or releasing the event.

The acknowledged Node `glob` experimental warning remains recorded. The latest
successful build also reported `PLUGIN_TIMINGS` (client phase 4.29 seconds); its
disposition remains unresolved. No warning suppression, dependency changes or
build-configuration changes were made. This is a work-in-progress snapshot, not
release acceptance.

## Diagnostic Commands

- `npm run install:ci`: perform the one locked dependency install
- `npm run dev`: start the Vite/Vinext development server
- `npm run build`: build the deployable Sites artifact
- `npm run start`: preview the built Worker locally with D1/R2 support
- `npm run db:generate`: generate Drizzle migrations after schema changes

When using the Sites plugin, follow its skill instructions for installation, builds, and publishing. These npm commands remain available for standalone use.

The portable build runs Vinext directly without a host `timeout` command. The managed-linux build uses `scripts/build-verified.sh` and its existing `SITES_BUILD_TIMEOUT` setting.
